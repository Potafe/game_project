DEVELOPMENT FOR GAME JAM 2025

Plan:

1. The x-axis and the y-axis are terrains, one can only move on either of them only
2. The world is finite (it is only limited to the screen size)
3. The animals will remain in the animal world only at first (which is the second quadrant)
4. Player will be in first quadrant only at first
5. The attack by animal can damage player when they are in same area the will first try to damage the x or y axis terrains (depending on which is more beneficial to them) of the first quadrant to reach the human world
6. Player can use hammer to restore the x and y-axis terrains of the other quadrants
7. Enemies will continously attack the player or the player world's axis
8. The theme is "waves" -> so for this I am thinking that the attack patterns can be trigonometric functions like sin, cos, tan
9. If the player's world's terrain is broken then the radiation/environment (which will also be a trigonometric function) will arise in the game which the player and intelligent enemies like demons and animals can ride and try to attack the player
